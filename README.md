# Voice pathology detection
I used ML for detect healthy and ill patients. Actually  I used two algorithms logistic regression and random forest with overall accuracy ~70%. I think the problem is signal processing due to get features, so I try different approach and test CNN in action.

accuracy = 0.7163636

Responisiblities
* Developed patient condition diagnostics system based on Machine Learning algorithms
* Designed and compared two approaches, classic machine learning and convolutional neural networks
* Built machine learning project pipeline: data analysis, features creation, model preparation, validation 

TODO
* documentation / README
* restructurize project architecture
